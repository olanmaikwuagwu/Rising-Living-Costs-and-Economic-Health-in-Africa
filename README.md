## Project Overview
In recent years, rising living costs have become a global concern, especially in emerging economies. Factors such as inflation, commodity price fluctuations, and domestic policies drive this trend, impacting both households and broader economic health. In many African countries, high inflation, volatile commodity prices, and currency fluctuations exacerbate the situation, further strained by limited infrastructure, import reliance, and unstable economic growth. This case study examines how rising living expenses affect economic stability and growth, with more emphasis on consumer behavior, inflation, employment, and poverty.

## Objectives
